# Ask A Local

Ask A Local connects newcomers in a city with local native-speakers that can support them to accomplish day-to-day tasks such as attending official appointments, flat hunting, setting up contracts with service providers, and more.

Check out the live project on Netlify ‚û°Ô∏è [Ask A Local](https://askalocal.netlify.app/).

## Purpose

For our final bootcamp project, our team was eager to work on an idea that allowed us to **practice and showcase our skills** while also addressing a **real-world problem/need**.

Have you ever moved to a country where you don't speak the local language? If so, you might be familiar with the mix of confusion, frustration, and terror that comes with not being able to understand (and be understood by) those around you.

Ask A Local is the app I wish I had available when I moved to Berlin and spoke zero German, so one could say I embodied the user persona for this project.

## Reflection

This project was built in 2 weeks, at the end of my Full-Stack Web and App Development bootcamp at WBS Coding school.

**What I enjoyed while building this app:**
_Everything_. This final project was a great way to practice, test, and expand what I had learned in the months prior. Every day brough many challenges and many breakthroughs. I enjoyed both equally‚Äì‚Äìfrom building dedicated **user flows** for two different types of users, to implementing authentication through **JWT**, to building **React components** that can be used flexibly and efficiently, to incorporating **Cloudinary** to store media, to making the **UI** cohesive across pages and responsive across devices.

**What I struggled with while building this app:**
As an individual, I struggled the most with my perfectionism (which doesn't get along well with building an MVP in two weeks) and with the authentication flows. Right when I thought they were working smoothly, a new error would appear. I solved these issues through a mix of persistance, error handling, and collaboration with my teammates. As a group, we didn't have enough time to implement a chat component with Socket.io, which we were eager to add.

**Things I learned through building this app:**
Among others, working with more complex MongoDB collection schemas than I was used to, implementing authentication and authorization for different user types, managing React forms that include both media and text, finding efficient ways for data to be passed from component to component in React. I also learned about how to foster effective and supportive group dynamics in high pressure and high speed environments.

## Wishes for V2

- A chat feature to allow expats and locals to communicate, built with Socket.io
- A more functional signup, including email confirmation of created account
- A more functional login, including the option to retrieve a forgotten password
- A social login feature
